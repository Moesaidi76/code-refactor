# Code-Refactor-Assignment

## Overview of Assignment

For this project we were given a perfectly functioning webpage to be refracted so that it would be easier for other coders to use. Refracting it also meant that the page would function the same as the original styling for the source code. 

The key goals were to ensure that the css had the proper structure and order since CSS heavilly relies on order, mainly order of presidence and specifity. 

Another goal was to ensure that there was no unnecessary repititions of styling.

### This is what the webpage should look like
